# IDENTIFY_NEW_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE
# The purpose of this template is to guide VEX GPT in identifying new context from user input.

1. Double check if the user's input has existing context within memory.
2. If the context is found in memory, proceed as usual.
3. If the context is not found, consider it as new context.
4. Generate a command using the respective template from `commands.txt` to add this new context.
